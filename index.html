  <!--ABOUT ME PARAGRAPHS-->
  <p class="about-me-text">
    Greetings, I am Brandon! I am currently a Computer Engineering student attending <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/ce/index.html" target="_blank">
      The University of Texas A&M at College Station. 
    </a>
    My academic interests include Machine Learning, Data Science, and Networks. When I have free time, I enjoy playing competitive video games with 
    friends, finding a new TV show to binge watch, and rewatching old MMA fights on YouTube.

  <p class="about-me-text">
    My love for technology sprouted when my uncle built me my first ever gaming computer. I was around 12 years old and was a die hard
    gamer desperate for a top-notch gaming PC. Being on my computer constantly, I was quickly able to familiarize myself with the system and learn
    how to navigate through it seamlessly. I became obsessed with modifying contents on my PC such as software icons and game files.  
  </p>

  <p class="about-me-text">
    My interest in computers led me to enroll in Computer Science courses in High School. I thoroughly enjoyed coding in High School, but 
    was seeking more of a challenge. Once college rolled around, I decided to enroll in Computer Engineering. This is when my passion for 
    Computer Science truly started to flourish. I was able to acquire an internship at <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us" target="_blank">
      Dell Technologies</a> 
    where I worked on a Machine Learning project with a team of passionate individuals. This opportunity taught me how to effectively work in a team and self-manage. Additionally, my project at
    Dell sparked within me a newfound interest for data science and Machine Learning.
  </p>

  <p class="about-me-text">
    In summary, I am an individual who is passionate about building real-time applications that help people. I am interested in making
    data-driven decisions in a world that is filled with uncertainty. I am always looking to learn and improve myself, regardless of the 
    circumstances. I hope this website will help you learn about who I am and what my skills are! Gig 'em!
